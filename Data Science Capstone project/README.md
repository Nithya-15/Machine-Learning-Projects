# IBM Data Science Capstone Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the final capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The goal of this project is to predict the success of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landing. SpaceX offers rocket launches at a significantly lower cost—$62 million compared to over $165 million by other providers—thanks to their ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By accurately predicting the likelihood of a successful landing, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This prediction is crucial for a startup that aims to compete with SpaceX in the commercial rocket launch market.

## Business Problem

SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket drastically reduces launch costs. Competing companies could benefit from predicting whether a launch will result in a successful landing, allowing them to make more informed bids against SpaceX. By applying data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to accurately predict the likelihood of a successful first stage landing.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to utilize data science and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. This prediction will help estimate the cost of a rocket launch, providing valuable insights for a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX.

## Deliverables

- **Predictive Models**: Development of accurate predictive algorithms to assess the likelihood of a successful first stage landing.
- **Business Case Report**: A comprehensive report detailing the findings and recommendations to stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making.

## Methodology

The project follows the standard Data Science methodology, including:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering real-world data related to SpaceX launches.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the data to uncover insights and patterns.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the data to enhance understanding and communication.
5. **Model Development**: Building and fine-tuning machine learning models to predict landing outcomes.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models to ensure accuracy and reliability.
7. **Reporting**: Communicating the results and recommendations to stakeholders.

## How to Use

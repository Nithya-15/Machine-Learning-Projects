its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.\n","\n","Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.\n","\n","This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket
